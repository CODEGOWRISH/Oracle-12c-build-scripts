CONVERT A 12C NON-CDB TO A CDB-PDB DATABASE

This scenario arises when we upgrade a 11g DB in-place to 12c.  
Then, the upgraded DB will be non-CDB.  
Oracle is going to deprecate non-CDB in 12c.
We therefore need to convert non-CDB 12c DB's to CDB with at least one PDB.

LIST DATAFILES IN THE NON-CDB DATABASE
asmcmd
ASMCMD> cd +DATA_DG01
ASMCMD> cd DB_UNIQUE_NAME
ASMCMD> ls -l
