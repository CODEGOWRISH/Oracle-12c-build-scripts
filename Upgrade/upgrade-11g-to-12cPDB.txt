UPGRADE FROM 11G to 12C PDB RAC
Complete Checklist for Manual Upgrades to Oracle Database 12c Release 1 (12.1) (Doc ID 1503653.1)

PRE-CHECKS (multiple steps below are bundled into pre-check.sql in this repository)

Note: The pre-check run from 12c home says EM DB Control (SYSMAN) will be removed during upgrade

CHECK: The 12c home pre-check can be run from its location itself
CHECK: Check if DB Links work as they were after upgrade and conversion to PDB

DUPLICATES AND INVALIDS
-- Check duplicate objects between SYS and SYSTEM
prompt

in (select OBJECT_NAME||OBJECT_TYPE from
DBA_OBJECTS where OWNER='SYS') and
OWNER='SYSTEM' and OBJECT_NAME not in
('AQ$_SCHEDULES_PRIMARY', 'AQ$_SCHEDULES',
'DBMS_REPCAT_AUTH');

select substr(owner,1,6) owner, substr(object_name,1,30) object, substr(object_type,1,30)
type, status, LAST_DDL_TIME from dba_objects where status <>'VALID' and owner like 'SYS%';

RUN PRE-UPGRADE DIAGNOSTIC SQL METALINK NOTE 556610.1
Run the script dbupgdiag.sql to diagnose oracle recommended items
NOTE: The script needs to be run in SQL*Plus both before the upgrade on the source database and after the upgrade on the upgraded database as SYS user. This will help to determine the status of the database before and after upgrade.
--> dbupgdiag.sql is in this folder in another sql file

It asks for a '1' - give an existing subdirectory name in the current folder to store its logfile.
Check logfile for errors, duplicates etc.

Pay attention to duplicates, invalid objects etc.
For fixing, metalink note 1030426.6

FIX ISSUES
@$ORACLE_HOME/rdbms/admin/utlrp.sql

RUN PRE-UPGRADE SCRIPT FROM 12C HOME

Run $ORACLE_HOME_12C/rdbms/admin/preupgrd.sql
After the run, it asks to do the following:
    1. Review results of the pre-upgrade checks:
     /u01/app/oracle/cfgtoollogs/DB_UNIQUE_NAME/preupgrade/preupgrade.log
    
    2. Execute in the SOURCE environment BEFORE upgrade:
     /u01/app/oracle/cfgtoollogs/DB_UNIQUE_NAME/preupgrade/preupgrade_fixups.sql
    
    3. Execute in the NEW environment AFTER upgrade:
     /u01/app/oracle/cfgtoollogs/DB_UNIQUE_NAME/preupgrade/postupgrade_fixups.sql


CHECK DATAGUARD STATUS
dgmgrl /
DGMGRL> show configuration;

This should show a good configuration with no transport/apply lag

GENERATE DB-LINK RE-CREATE SCRIPT
Upon upgrade passwords in DB-links will be encrypted in 12c - unlike un-encrypted in 11g.
Create a db-link re-creator script using the following SQL.
NOTE: Upon upgrade AND conversion to PDB, check if DB-Links work as they were in 11g - most possibly, we may need to create them again at PDB level

    SELECT 'CREATE '||DECODE(U.NAME,'PUBLIC','public ')||'DATABASE LINK '||CHR(10)
    ||DECODE(U.NAME,'PUBLIC',Null, 'SYS','',U.NAME||'.')|| L.NAME||chr(10)
    ||'CONNECT TO ' || L.USERID || ' IDENTIFIED BY "'||L.PASSWORD||'" USING
    '''||L.HOST||''''
    ||chr(10)||';' TEXT
    FROM SYS.LINK$ L, SYS.USER$ U
    WHERE L.OWNER# = U.USER#;

CHECK TIMEZONE FILE IF IT NEEDS UPDATE
Ver 18 timezone file is supplied with 12c.
Check note 1509653.1 to update DST using DBMS_DST.

CHECK IF ANY FILE NEEDS MEDIA RECOVERY
select * from v$recover_file;

CHECK IF ANY FILES ARE IN BACKUP MODE
select * from v$backup where status != 'NOT ACTIVE';

NOTE LOCATION OF FILES
SELECT name FROM v$controlfile;
SELECT file_name FROM dba_data_files;
SELECT group#, member FROM v$logfile;

BACKUP CONFIG FILES
init.ora, listener.ora, tnsnames.ora

REMOVE DB-CONTROL OF ENTERPRISE MANAGER
emctl stop dbcontrol
@$ORACLE_HOME_12C/rdbms/admin/emremove.sql

DISABLE/BLACKOUT ALERTS, BACKUPS ETC
Disable scripts, cron, oem etc that do backups, alerting etc.
Stop/suspend jobs using DBMS_SCHEDULER, DBMS_JOB etc.

DATA GUARD SETUP
Disable fast start failover, and configuration
DGMGRL> DISABLE FAST_START FAILOVER;
DGMGRL> DISABLE CONFIGURATION;

Connect to both primary & standby and stop the broker.
sqlplus / as sysdba
SQL> ALTER SYSTEM SET DG_BROKER_START=FALSE SCOPE=BOTH;

Take backup of broker configuration files in both primary and standby
    Do this for both config files dg_config_file1.dat  and dg_config_file2.dat
    Name f/s file to distinguish these between primary and standby
    SQL> show parameter dg_broker_config_file
    ASMCMD> cp <ASM file>  <f/s file>
    
BACKUP SPFILE
SQL> create pfile='$ORACLE_HOME/dbs/initDBNAME.ora.preUpgrade' from spfile;

PURGE RECYCLE BIN
SQL> purge dba_recyclebin;

COLLECT DICTIONARY STATISTICS
SQL> exec dbms_stats.gather_dictionary_stats;

PURGE PENDING TWO PHASE COMMITS
SQL> SELECT local_tran_id FROM dba_2pc_pending;
SQL> EXECUTE dbms_transaction.purge_lost_db_entry('');
SQL> COMMIT;

ENSURE NO MV-REFRESH IS  IN PROGRESS
SQL> select s.obj#,o.obj#,s.containerobj#,lastrefreshdate,pflags,xpflags,o.name,o.owner#, bitand(s.mflags, 8) 
from obj$ o, sum$ s
where o.obj# = s.obj# and o.type# = 42 AND bitand(s.mflags, 8) = 8;
Note 1442457.1 : During 11g Upgrade, Mview refresh warning.
If any active refresh is reported, wait for its completion.

MAKE DEFAULT TABLESPACE OF SYS AND SYSTEM as SYSTEM TABLESPACE

CHECK AND STOP/COMPLETE ANY ACTIVE BACKUPS
SQL> SELECT * FROM v$backup WHERE status != 'NOT ACTIVE';
