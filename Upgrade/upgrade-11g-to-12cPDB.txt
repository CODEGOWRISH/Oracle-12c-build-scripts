UPGRADE FROM 11G to 12C PDB RAC
Complete Checklist for Manual Upgrades to Oracle Database 12c Release 1 (12.1) (Doc ID 1503653.1)

PRE-CHECKS (multiple steps below are bundled into pre-check.sql in this repository)

Note: The pre-check run from 12c home says EM DB Control (SYSMAN) will be removed during upgrade

CHECK: The 12c home pre-check can be run from its location itself
CHECK: Check if DB Links work as they were after upgrade and conversion to PDB

DUPLICATES AND INVALIDS
-- Check duplicate objects between SYS and SYSTEM

DBA_OBJECTS where OBJECT_NAME||OBJECT_TYPE
in (select OBJECT_NAME||OBJECT_TYPE from
DBA_OBJECTS where OWNER='SYS') and
OWNER='SYSTEM' and OBJECT_NAME not in
('AQ$_SCHEDULES_PRIMARY', 'AQ$_SCHEDULES',
'DBMS_REPCAT_AUTH');

-- Check invalid objects
prompt

select substr(owner,1,6) owner, substr(object_name,1,30) object, substr(object_type,1,30)
type, status, LAST_DDL_TIME from dba_objects where status <>'VALID' and owner like 'SYS%';

RUN PRE-UPGRADE DIAGNOSTIC SQL METALINK NOTE 556610.1
Run the script dbupgdiag.sql to diagnose oracle recommended items
NOTE: The script needs to be run in SQL*Plus both before the upgrade on the source database and after the upgrade on the upgraded database as SYS user. This will help to determine the status of the database before and after upgrade.
--> dbupgdiag.sql is in this folder in another sql file

It asks for a '1' - give an existing subdirectory name in the current folder to store its logfile.
Check logfile for errors, duplicates etc.

Pay attention to duplicates, invalid objects etc.
For fixing, metalink note 1030426.6

FIX ISSUES
@$ORACLE_HOME/rdbms/admin/utlrp.sql

RUN PRE-UPGRADE SCRIPT FROM 12C HOME

Run $ORACLE_HOME_12C/rdbms/admin/preupgrd.sql
After the run, it asks to do the following:
    1. Review results of the pre-upgrade checks:
     /u01/app/oracle/cfgtoollogs/DB_UNIQUE_NAME/preupgrade/preupgrade.log
    
    2. Execute in the SOURCE environment BEFORE upgrade:
     /u01/app/oracle/cfgtoollogs/DB_UNIQUE_NAME/preupgrade/preupgrade_fixups.sql
    
    3. Execute in the NEW environment AFTER upgrade:
     /u01/app/oracle/cfgtoollogs/DB_UNIQUE_NAME/preupgrade/postupgrade_fixups.sql
