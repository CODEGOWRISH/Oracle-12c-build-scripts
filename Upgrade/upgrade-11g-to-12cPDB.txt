UPGRADE FROM 11G to 12C PDB RAC
Complete Checklist for Manual Upgrades to Oracle Database 12c Release 1 (12.1) (Doc ID 1503653.1)

PRE-CHECKS (multiple steps below are bundled into pre-check.sql in this repository)

Note: The pre-check run from 12c home says EM DB Control (SYSMAN) will be removed during upgrade

CHECK: The 12c home pre-check can be run from its location itself
CHECK: Check if DB Links work as they were after upgrade and conversion to PDB

DUPLICATES AND INVALIDS
-- Check duplicate objects between SYS and SYSTEM
prompt
prompt Check duplicate objects between SYS and SYSTEM

select OBJECT_NAME, OBJECT_TYPE from
DBA_OBJECTS where OBJECT_NAME||OBJECT_TYPE
in (select OBJECT_NAME||OBJECT_TYPE from
DBA_OBJECTS where OWNER='SYS') and
OWNER='SYSTEM' and OBJECT_NAME not in
('AQ$_SCHEDULES_PRIMARY', 'AQ$_SCHEDULES',
'DBMS_REPCAT_AUTH');

-- Check invalid objects
prompt
prompt Checking invalid objects in SYS and SYSTEM users
prompt
select substr(owner,1,6) owner, substr(object_name,1,30) object, substr(object_type,1,30)
type, status, LAST_DDL_TIME from dba_objects where status <>'VALID' and owner like 'SYS%';

RUN PRE-UPGRADE DIAGNOSTIC SQL METALINK NOTE 556610.1
Run the script dbupgdiag.sql to diagnose oracle recommended items
NOTE: The script needs to be run in SQL*Plus both before the upgrade on the source database and after the upgrade on the upgraded database as SYS user. This will help to determine the status of the database before and after upgrade.
--> dbupgdiag.sql is in this folder in another sql file

It asks for a '1' - give an existing subdirectory name in the current folder to store its logfile.
Check logfile for errors, duplicates etc.

Pay attention to duplicates, invalid objects etc.
For fixing, metalink note 1030426.6

FIX ISSUES
@$ORACLE_HOME/rdbms/admin/utlrp.sql

RUN PRE-UPGRADE SCRIPT FROM 12C HOME

Run $ORACLE_HOME_12C/rdbms/admin/preupgrd.sql
After the run, it asks to do the following:
    1. Review results of the pre-upgrade checks:
     /u01/app/oracle/cfgtoollogs/DB_UNIQUE_NAME/preupgrade/preupgrade.log
    
    2. Execute in the SOURCE environment BEFORE upgrade:
     /u01/app/oracle/cfgtoollogs/DB_UNIQUE_NAME/preupgrade/preupgrade_fixups.sql
    
    3. Execute in the NEW environment AFTER upgrade:
     /u01/app/oracle/cfgtoollogs/DB_UNIQUE_NAME/preupgrade/postupgrade_fixups.sql


CHECK DATAGUARD STATUS
dgmgrl /
DGMGRL> show configuration;

This should show a good configuration with no transport/apply lag

GENERATE DB-LINK RE-CREATE SCRIPT
Upon upgrade passwords in DB-links will be encrypted in 12c - unlike un-encrypted in 11g.
Create a db-link re-creator script using the following SQL.
NOTE: Upon upgrade AND conversion to PDB, check if DB-Links work as they were in 11g - most possibly, we may need to create them again at PDB level

    SELECT 'CREATE '||DECODE(U.NAME,'PUBLIC','public ')||'DATABASE LINK '||CHR(10)
    ||DECODE(U.NAME,'PUBLIC',Null, 'SYS','',U.NAME||'.')|| L.NAME||chr(10)
    ||'CONNECT TO ' || L.USERID || ' IDENTIFIED BY "'||L.PASSWORD||'" USING
    '''||L.HOST||''''
    ||chr(10)||';' TEXT
    FROM SYS.LINK$ L, SYS.USER$ U
    WHERE L.OWNER# = U.USER#;

CHECK TIMEZONE FILE IF IT NEEDS UPDATE
Ver 18 timezone file is supplied with 12c.
Check note 1509653.1 to update DST using DBMS_DST.

CHECK IF ANY FILE NEEDS MEDIA RECOVERY
select * from v$recover_file;

CHECK IF ANY FILES ARE IN BACKUP MODE
select * from v$backup where status != 'NOT ACTIVE';
